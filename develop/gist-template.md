# Regex Tutorial: Matching an Email

A tutorial that demonstrates how a particular regular expression (regex) works by dissecting each component of the expression and explaining its function.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we'll be exploring a regex pattern designed to match email addresses. We'll break down the pattern to understand how it identifies key components of an email, such as the username, the "@" symbol, and the domain name. This regex ensures that the email follows the standard format and captures common variations.

Here’s the regex pattern we’ll be working with:

`/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`

We'll explain each part of this regex, showing how it validates the structure of an email address, ensuring that it only matches correctly formatted emails.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors: `^` and `$`

Pattern:
`^...$`

`^` asserts the position at the start of the string.
`$` asserts the position at the end of the string.
Purpose: These anchors ensure that the entire string must conform to the pattern, from beginning to end.

Code Snippet:

`/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers: `+`

Pattern:
`[a-z0-9_\.-]+`

`+` is a greedy quantifier that matches one or more of the preceding element.
Purpose: Ensures that the matched part has one or more of the specified characters.

Code Snippet:

`([a-z0-9_\.-]+)`  # Matches one or more characters for username

### Character Classes
Character Classes: `[a-z0-9_\.-]` and `[\da-z\.-]`

Pattern:
`[a-z0-9_\.-]`

`[a-z0-9_\.-]` defines a set of acceptable characters, including lowercase letters, digits, underscores, dots, and hyphens.
`[\da-z\.-]` allows digits, lowercase letters, dots, and hyphens.
Purpose: Specifies which characters are valid at different parts of the email.

Code Snippet:

`[a-z0-9_\.-]+`  For username
`[\da-z\.-]+`    For domain name
`[a-z\.]{2,6}`   For TLD

### Grouping and Capturing
Grouping and Capturing: `(...)`

Pattern:
`([a-z0-9_\.-]+)`

`(...)` captures a group of characters. The content matched by this group can be referenced or extracted.
Purpose: Allows us to capture different parts of the email address separately.

Code Snippet:

`^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)`  Captures username
`@([\da-z\.-]+)`    Captures domain
`\.([a-z\.]{2,6})`  Captures TLD

### Bracket Expressions
Bracket Expressions: `[a-z0-9_\.-]`, `[\da-z\.-]`, `[a-z\.]{2,6}`

Pattern:
`[a-z0-9_\.-]`

`[a-z0-9_\.-]` specifies a set of acceptable characters for the username.
`[\da-z\.-]` specifies characters for the domain.
`[a-z\.]{2,6}` specifies characters and length for the TLD.
Purpose: Defines the characters that can appear in different parts of the email address.

Code Snippet:

`[a-z0-9_\.-]+` Matches valid username characters
`[\da-z\.-]+`   Matches valid domain characters
`[a-z\.]{2,6}`  Matches valid TLD characters

### Boundaries
Boundaries: Start and End

Pattern:
`^...$`

Start `(^)` ensures matching from the beginning of the string.
End `($)` ensures matching up to the end of the string.
Purpose: Ensures the entire string fits the pattern, preventing partial matches.

Code Snippet:

`/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`
